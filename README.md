# wp-jquery-migrate-remover

This plugin simply removes jQuery Migrate from a Wordpress site. It has no configuration options at all. Simply enable it and enjoy the reduced bloat!

jQuery Migrate is used to help migrate away from deprecated features of jQuery core. It adds back removed APIs and prints warnings to the console when removed or deprecated APIs are being used. However, this is not needed unless your site uses out of date jQuery based plugins, and this default feature of Wordpress can safely be removed, helping pages to load faster.

We use this plugin at [Bidwell Websites](https://bidwellwebsites.com/) to keep our clients' sites more lightweight.
